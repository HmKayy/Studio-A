The entire project has been overhauled.
There are now 5 main files
Charts: Containing the classes of the 3 required graphs
DataManager: contains DataManager Object, its main task is to save/load data/config
DataProcessor: contains the DataProcessor Object, its main task is to do simple calculation
like max/min/average/std/sum, it also has functions to create card to show off the calculation
Main: where everything pertaining to GUI is contained (labels,buttons,boxes,containers,etc)
VideoGame: contain the class of the Data.
Everything is mostly complete by now, only needs some simple testing and bug fixing
